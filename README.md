# One Million Checkboxes
The code that powered [One Million Checkboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Checkboxes)

## THIS CODE IS MESSY
I have made no attempt to clean up this code. My git hygiene was really bad. At many points I wrote awful hacky code. Sorry.

If you're interested in reading this code, I recommend that you begin with [the code as it existed when I launched the site](https://github.com/nolenroyalty/one-million-checkboxes/tree/71b296ec74adbd941431559ff1d7358d817a03cb) and then observe how it evolved over time. I think that's a much better way of learning what I did than simply looking at the end result. There are a lot of problems with the end result! It's not good code.

See [this blog post](https://eieio.games/essays/scaling-one-million-checkboxes/) for some details on the changes that I made to the site to scale it up.

## Want the data?
The data from One Million Checkboxes is available [on the internet archive](https://archive.org/details/one-million-checkboxes-data). And a [separate repo of mine](https://github.com/nolenroyalty/one-million-checkboxes-data-scripts) provides scripts for working with the data.


## Thanks for everything
It was really special to get to run this site. Thanks for playing :)
